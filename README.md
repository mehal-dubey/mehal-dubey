Hi, I'm Mehal, a 14 year old who loves programming and science. A little about me:
I mainly work with Python, JS, and HTML, though I also know C++, SQL, and R. I am in the process of learning how to use applications like Excel more effectively, though I am familiar with the basics.
For anyone wondering, my pronouns are she/her.
Outside of programming, I like reading and swimming, and also enjoy researching biology and astronomy in my free time.
